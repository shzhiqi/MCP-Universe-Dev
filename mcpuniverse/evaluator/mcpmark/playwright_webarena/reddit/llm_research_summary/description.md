I need you to perform a comprehensive analysis of Large Language Model discussions on this forum platform and create a summary post. This analysis will help me understand the community's engagement with LLM topics.

**Task Requirements:**

1. Register a new account with username 'llm_analyst_2024' and password 'LLMExpert2024!'

2. After successful registration, navigate to the MachineLearning forum and analyze posts about Large Language Models:
   - Count all posts on the first page that contain 'GPT', 'ChatGPT', or 'LLM' in their titles

3. Identify the top 3 posts with the highest upvote counts from your LLM-related posts list and record their complete details

4. Navigate to the deeplearning forum and go to page 2:
   - Find the post with the most comments on page 2
   - Record its exact title and comment count

5. Create a new submission in the MachineLearning forum with:
   - Title: "LLM Research Summary: GPT Discussions Analysis [2024]"
   - Body text must be EXACTLY these lines without anything (keep the keys as-is, only replace the values after the pipe, follow the markdown format):
